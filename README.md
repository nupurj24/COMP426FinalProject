# COMP426 Final Project

Team Members: Nupur Joshi, Jaden Juarez, Evan Menendez, Jonathan Weaver 

## Project Overview 

We have created a convenient task tracker web application using the MEAN stack. The MEAN stack consists of the MongoDB Atlas database which stores a user's tasks and its associated attributes such as the task title, task description, and task priority level. We used Express and Node.js for the server-side of the application and used Express to create our CRUD operations and RESTful API. We used Angular to build the client-side of our application and to create the front-end. For our third party API, we used a free weather API to display the current weather so that users can know how the weather may impact their plans to get some work done! Users can add, edit, and delete tasks as they wish and with the persistence provided by our database they will not lose their task list!
